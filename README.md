# LBZ's personal C language codebase
## What is this?
This is a place where old (or new) C files for school projects are dumped. They may or may not be related to any homework or asisgnment. The moral of the story is, when I write something that is not graded, I do not want my effort to go unrecorded.
## What are included here?
Hopefully, the code here can be reused later for other projects, since many of these have been written with a more or less sense of generality.
## Table of contents
|Directory|Content|Functionality|
|---------|-------|-------------|
|_examples|some examples using apis in other folders|verify (or un-verify?) that the code works|
|curses|```colors.c```, ```curses.c```, ```curses.h```, ```test.c```|a wrapper for the ncurses library|
|funclist|```funclist.c```, ```funclist.h```, ```test.c```|helper classes for writing generic code in C|
|networking|```networking.c```, ```networking.h```, ```test.c```|helper classes for socket programming, implementing TCP / UDP services, etc.|
|strings|```strings.c```, ```strings.h```, ```test.c```|helper classes to deal with nasty string operations in C|
## Liscence?
No liscence. Use them if you trust that the code works. I do not trust them.
